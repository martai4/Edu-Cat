Discover your future with a simple drawing! Our app analyzes your personality through a fun house drawing and suggests the perfect universities based on your interests.

Our project helps young people make decisions about their future. Using a short form, we learn about the user's main areas of interest. We also have a unique section that involves drawing. The user has to draw a house, while the application, using a trained neural network, analyzes the person's character and personality according to the Holland code. After analyzing the preferences, and personality of the person filling out the survey, a ranking of recommended universities is returned.
